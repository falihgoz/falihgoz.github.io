I am a **Seasonal Academic** at [Federation University Australia](https://federation.edu.au/).
I completed my **PhD in IT** at Federation University, supported by the [Data61 PhD Scholarship](https://www.csiro.au/en/careers/scholarships-student-opportunities/postgraduate-programs-and-scholarships/data61-scholarships).

I also hold a **Master of Technology** in Enterprise Systems and Business Analytics from Federation University, and a **Bachelor of Computer Science** from [Brawijaya University, Indonesia](https://ub.ac.id/).

My research interests include:

- Signal Processing
- Artificial Intelligence
- Graph Learning
- Anomaly Detection

I have been developing novel approaches for classification and anomaly detection, applying these techniques to domains such as **cyber-physical systems**, **audio signal processing**, and **brain disease detection**.
