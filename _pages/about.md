Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at [Federation University Australia, Australia](https://federation.edu.au/), and I am also affiliated with [CSIRO's Data61](https://research.csiro.au/cybersecurity-quantum-systems/). During my candidature, I have been supported by the [Data61 PhD Scholarship](https://www.csiro.au/en/careers/scholarships-student-opportunities/postgraduate-programs-and-scholarships/data61-scholarships).

I hold a Master of Technology degree from [Federation University Australia, Australia](https://federation.edu.au/), specializing in enterprise systems and business analytics. Before that, I completed my Bachelor of Computer Science from [Brawijaya University, Indonesia](https://ub.ac.id/).

I am interested in the fields of `Artificial Intelligence, Graph Learning, and Anomaly Detection`. Recently, my research has been centred around harnessing the capabilities of graph neural networks to detect anomalies. In the past year, I have been actively applying this technique to different domains, such as cyber-physical systems and the detection of brain diseases.
